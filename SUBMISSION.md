### What it does

KawaFi provides a unified interface for AI assistants (like Claude) to interact with the Hedera DeFi ecosystem. It offers 36 comprehensive tools that enable:

- **Real-time DeFi Analytics**: Get swap quotes, pool reserves, APYs, lending rates, and liquidation opportunities
- **Transaction Preparation**: Generate unsigned transactions for external signing (hardware wallets, dApps)
- **Automated Execution**: Optionally sign and execute DeFi operations directly (staking, swapping, lending)
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Access SaucerSwap DEX (19 tools), Bonzo lending (3 tools), Stader staking (3 tools), HeliSwap DEX (1 tool), and Hashport bridge (10 tools) through a single interface

The innovative dual-mode system allows users to choose between maximum security (prepare-only mode) or full automation (execute mode).

### The problem it solves

DeFi on Hedera is fragmented across multiple platforms, each with different APIs, interfaces, and complexities. Users and developers face several challenges:

1. **Complexity Barrier**: Understanding and integrating with multiple DeFi protocols requires deep technical knowledge
2. **Manual Operations**: Monitoring opportunities and executing strategies across platforms is time-consuming
3. **Security Concerns**: Many automation tools require private keys, creating unacceptable security risks
4. **Lack of AI Integration**: No existing solution allows AI assistants to safely interact with Hedera DeFi

KawaFi solves these by providing a secure, unified interface that AI assistants can use to access DeFi data and prepare transactions without ever exposing private keys.

### Challenges I ran into

1. **Platform Heterogeneity**: Each DeFi platform uses different approaches (REST APIs vs smart contracts), requiring custom client implementations for each

2. **Security vs Automation Trade-off**: Balancing the need for automation with security led to developing the innovative dual-mode system

3. **Limited Platform Availability**: Not all platforms are available on testnet, requiring careful network-specific initialization logic

4. **Authentication Requirements**: SaucerSwap's private API key system required implementing graceful degradation when credentials aren't available

5. **Transaction Complexity**: Hedera's unique transaction model required careful handling of transaction building, signing, and submission flows

### Technologies I used

**Core Stack:**
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** - MCP protocol implementation
- **@hashgraph/sdk** - Hedera blockchain interactions
- **Ethers.js** - Smart contract ABI encoding/decoding
- **Zod** - Runtime schema validation
- **Axios** - REST API communication

**Development Tools:**
- **ESM Modules** - Modern JavaScript module system
- **tsx** - TypeScript execution for development
- **TypeScript Compiler** - Production builds

### How we built it

1. **Research Phase**: Analyzed each DeFi platform's API documentation and smart contracts to understand integration requirements

2. **Architecture Design**: Created a modular client-based architecture where each platform has its own client module with a common interface

3. **MCP Integration**: Built the server using the MCP SDK, exposing each DeFi operation as a tool with strict schema validation

4. **Dual-Mode Innovation**: Developed the prepare/execute mode system to address security concerns while maintaining automation capabilities

5. **Progressive Implementation**:
   - Started with read-only operations for all platforms
   - Implemented transaction execution for Stader (simplest contract interaction)
   - Built comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Created detailed documentation and testing guides

6. **Security-First Approach**: Implemented environment-based configuration with clear warnings and best practices documentation

7. **NPM Distribution**: Published as `kawa-fi-mcp` package for easy installation via `npm install -g kawa-fi-mcp` with simple MCP config: `{"command": "npx", "args": ["kawa-fi-mcp"]}`

### What we learned

1. **Security is Paramount**: The DeFi space demands extreme caution - our dual-mode approach proved essential for user trust

2. **Modularity Enables Scaling**: The client-based architecture made it easy to add new platforms without affecting existing code

3. **AI + DeFi is Powerful**: Combining AI assistants with DeFi access opens new possibilities for automated strategies and analysis

4. **Documentation is Critical**: Comprehensive guides for setup, testing, and security were crucial for adoption

5. **Graceful Degradation Works**: Making the server functional even without all credentials increased accessibility

### What's next for KawaFi

**Immediate Plans:**
- Complete transaction execution for remaining platforms (Bonzo lending)
- Add multi-hop swap optimization across DEXs
- Implement position monitoring and alerts

**Advanced Features:**
- Flash loan integration for arbitrage opportunities
- Batch transaction support for complex strategies
- Cross-platform yield optimization algorithms
- Integration with more Hedera DeFi platforms

**Long-term Vision:**
- Become the standard MCP server for Hedera DeFi interactions
- Enable sophisticated AI-driven DeFi strategies
- Build a ecosystem of tools and plugins around the server
- Support for other blockchain ecosystems using similar architecture
